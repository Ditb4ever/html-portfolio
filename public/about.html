<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I like computer programming, and I've started learning HTML web development so that I can eventually start making apps and 
websites all by myself, and I am planning on taking an ethical hacking course once that is complete. 
</p>

<p>Computer programming has always been one of my interests, even as a kid. I wanted to know how the Internet worked, how webpages 
and apps work, and now I am learning how to do those very things! 
</p>

<p>It's basically a dream come true just learning how to program, and it would be even better if I kept on learning and eventually 
became a professional web developer.
